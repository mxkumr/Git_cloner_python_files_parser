# Git_cloner_python_files_parser

A Python tool that analyzes code in GitHub repositories. It identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, constants, comments, and non-English content from Python files. The tool generates detailed JSON and CSV reports and supports batch processing for multiple repositories.

## Scripts

### 1. `code_analyzer.py`

**Description:**
This script is responsible for analyzing the code within Python files. It parses the code, identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, constants, comments, and non-English text in the code. It uses the `libcst` library to parse and traverse the code and the `langdetect` library to detect non-English comments and literals.

**Main Functions:**
- `CodeAnalyzer`: A class that inherits from `CSTVisitor` to analyze the parsed code.
- `analyze_code`: Wraps the code parsing and analysis logic.
- `analyze_directory`: Recursively scans a directory for Python files, performs the analysis, and aggregates the results.

### 2. `repo_analyzer.py`

**Description:**
This script clones multiple GitHub repositories and analyzes the Python files in them. It uses the `code_analyzer.py` script to perform the analysis and outputs the results in both JSON and CSV formats. It provides functionality to:
- Clone repositories from GitHub.
- Find Python files in the cloned repository.
- Analyze those files for keywords, identifiers, literals, constants, comments, and non-English text.
- Output the results to both JSON and CSV formats for further inspection or reporting.

**Main Functions:**
- `clone_repo`: Clones the repository from GitHub to a temporary directory.
- `find_py_files`: Finds all Python files within the cloned repository.
- `analyze_repo`: Handles the process of cloning, finding files, and analyzing them. Outputs results in JSON and CSV formats.
- `main`: Loops through the list of repositories (`REPO_LIST`) and analyzes each one.

### 3. `analysis_output.json`

**Description:**
This file is the JSON output generated by the `repo_analyzer.py` script. It contains the results of the code analysis for each repository and each Python file. The JSON file stores the following data:
- `repo_url`: The URL of the GitHub repository.
- `file_name`: The name of the Python file being analyzed.
- `keywords`: A list of Python keywords found in the file.
- `identifiers`: A list of identifiers (non-keywords) found in the file.
- `comments`: A list of comments found in the file.
- `non_english`: A list of non-English comments or literals detected in the file.

### 4. `analysis_output.csv`

**Description:**
This file is the CSV version of the analysis results. It stores the same data as `analysis_output.json` but in a tabular format suitable for use in spreadsheets or data processing tools. The columns in the CSV file include:
- `repo_url`: The URL of the GitHub repository.
- `file_name`: The name of the Python file being analyzed.
- `keywords`: A comma-separated string of Python keywords found in the file.
- `identifiers`: A comma-separated string of identifiers (non-keywords) found in the file.
- `comments`: A string containing all comments found in the file.
- `non_english`: A string containing all non-English comments or literals found in the file.
